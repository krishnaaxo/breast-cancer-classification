# breast-cancer-classification
The project aims to compare the performance of Artificial Neural Networks which are used predominantly in the Health industry with less complex algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression , Random Forest Regressor and Kernel SVM . In the project I have used Wisconsin breast cancer dataset to train the algorithm .The result shows that Artificial Neural Networks out performs the other ML algorithms and they can be used for accurate classification.
